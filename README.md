<h1 align="center">Gem Creatures</h1>
<p align="center">An open world 2D game inspired by the Pok√©mon and The Legend of Zelda franchises</p>

## üéÆ About
Gem Creatures (name is only a placeholder) has as its main inspirations the Pok√©mon Red/ Blue/ Yellow games and The Legend of Zelda games: Link's Awakening and Breath of the Wild, as well as Yatch Club Games' in development Mina the Hollower.

This game's art style is a tribute to the Game Boy Color games while its gameplay mixes Zelda and Pok√©mon elements with some new ideas thrown in.

In Gem Creatures you get to play as an young adventurer that explores the world taming creatures to help him on the way.
Together, the adventurer and his creatures must fight, solve puzzles and discover more and more places to explore.

## üìñ Story
The story takes place in a steampunk world chock-full of natural environments little touched by mankind menaced by political conflicts and man-made catastrophes and inhabited by the humans and the Gem Creatures.

These creatures have their name due to gems that each carry with them in which they can enter in a compact way.
They live their lifes peacefully in the nature and can be either hunted or tamed by men. While some of them are aggresive, some are docile and people even have them as best friends.

## ‚ùó In Development
This game is a project that is only starting. It's my first game with Game Maker Studio 2 and my first open world game.
Since its scope is pretty big, initially a prototype is being developed starting now on January 2024. The prototype is scheduled to be finished in one or two months.
